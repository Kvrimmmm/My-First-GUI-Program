# 📝 My First GUI Program - To-Do List (C++)

## 📌 Overview

This project is a **desktop To-Do List application** built using **C++** with a graphical user interface (GUI).  
It allows users to **add, edit, and delete tasks**, providing a simple way to manage daily activities.  
This was my first attempt at building a GUI program in C++.
